## ☣️⛔️☢️ WARNING:

- **Prolonged exposure may cause spontaneous enlightenment.**  
- **Side effects include existential vertigo, recursive laughter, and the inability to give straight answers ever again.**

## ❓ What is this place?

This is **The Thought Collider**—a repository of **riddles, paradoxes, thought experiments, and reality-breaking questions** designed to stretch, twist, and unravel the mind.  

Here, questions have answers, but the answers lead to more questions. Here, every paradox is a doorway, and every doorway leads back to where you started—but not as the same person.
